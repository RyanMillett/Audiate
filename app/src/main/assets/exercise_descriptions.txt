Exercise: Simple Pentatonic Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 1
Description: A listening exercise designed to test the user's ability to identify simple pentatonic intervals.
             Simple pentatonic scales are generated from stacking five perfect-fifths in sequence and then transposing each intervals down in octaves to form a scale.
             Pentatonic scales created with this method will not contain any interval less than a major whole-tone (approximately 200 cents).
             More unconventional or exotic pentatonic scales generated by different means can produce smaller intervals.
