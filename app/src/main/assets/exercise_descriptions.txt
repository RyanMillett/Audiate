Exercise: Simple Pentatonic Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 1
Description: A listening exercise designed to test the user's ability to identify simple pentatonic intervals.
             Simple pentatonic scales are generated from stacking five perfect-fifths in sequence and then transposing each intervals down in octaves to form a scale.
             Pentatonic scales created with this method will not contain any interval less than a major whole-tone (approximately 200 cents).
             More unconventional or exotic pentatonic scales generated by different means can produce smaller intervals.

Exercise: Heptadiatonic Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 1
Description: A heptatonic scale is a musical scale that has seven steps per octave. Heptadiatonic (often called "diatonic") refers to the conventional seven-note "Major" scale.
             This exercise tests the user's ability to identify intervals from the heptadiatonic scale and its modes.

Difficulty: 1
Description: A heptatonic scale is a musical scale that has seven steps per octave. Heptadiatonic (often called "diatonic") refers to the conventional seven-note "Major" scale.
             This exercise tests the user's ability to perform intervals from the heptadiatonic scale and its modes.

Exercise: 12-Tone Equal-Tempered Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 3
Description: The 12-tone equal-tempered scale dives the octave in twelve equally-space "semi-tone" intervals (100 cents).
             This exercise tests the user's ability to identify intervals freely sampled from this scale.

Exercise: 12-Tone Equal-Tempered Intervals
Mode: Singing
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 4
Description: The 12-tone equal-tempered scale dives the octave in twelve equally-space "semi-tone" intervals (100 cents).
             This exercise tests the user's ability to perform intervals from this scale.
//
Exercise: 24-Tone Equal-Tempered Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 4
Description: The 24-tone equal-tempered scale dives the octave in twenty-four equally-space "quarter-tone" intervals (50 cents) and is the most common microtonal scale.
             This exercise tests the user's ability to identify intervals freely sampled from this scale.

Exercise: 24-Tone Equal-Tempered Intervals
Mode: Singing
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 5
Description: The 24-tone equal-tempered scale dives the octave in twenty-four equally-space "quarter-tone" intervals (50 cents) and is the most common microtonal scale.
             This exercise tests the user's ability to perform intervals from this scale.
//
Exercise: 36-Tone Equal-Tempered Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 4
Description: The 36-tone equal-tempered scale dives the octave in thirty-six equally-space "third-tone" intervals (approximately 33.33 cents).
             The basis for this scale is using the difference between an equally-tempered minor-seventh and a just-minor seventh as the generative interval.
             This exercise tests the user's ability to identify intervals freely sampled from this scale.

Exercise: Commas
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 5
Description: A comma is a minute interval, the difference resulting from tuning one note two different ways, and are often defined as the difference in size between two semitones.
             Commas can be very small intervals, often less than the "Just-noticeable difference" (JND) which is about 10 cents.
             This is a very difficult exercise design to test the user's ability to recognize various commas ranging from 1-65 cents.
//
Exercise: Sub-Semicomma Intervals
Mode: Listening
Material: Intervals
Difficulty: 6
Description: The Semicomma or "Fokker's comma" is an interval that exists on the threshold of the "Just-noticeable difference" (JND)--about 10 cents.
             Intervals below this are virtually impossible to distinguish when played in sequence and in most settings can only be detected if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies--an interference pattern between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, perceived as a periodic variation in volume whose rate is the difference of the two frequencies.
             This is the most difficult test available.
